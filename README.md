- **Result Viewing:**
  - Retrieve and display the details of all candidates, including their ID, name, and vote count.
  - View the details of a specific candidate.

## Tools

- **Remix Ethereum IDE:**
  - A web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for writing, testing, and deploying Ethereum smart contracts.

- **MetaMask:**
  - A browser extension that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and securely manage Ethereum accounts and transactions.

- **Ganache:**
  - A personal blockchain for Ethereum development that allows developers to deploy contracts, develop, and test their applications in a safe and deterministic environment.
